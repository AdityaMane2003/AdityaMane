# Email Spam Classifier

A machine learning-based tool to classify emails as spam or non-spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project demonstrates the complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocessing of email text (tokenization, stemming, etc.).
- Machine learning models for classification (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).
- Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Extendable for real-time email classification.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains datasets for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model training.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing and model deployment.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
